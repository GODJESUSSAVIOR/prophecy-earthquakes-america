Brandon Dale Biggs, a Pastor hailing from Oklahoma, a self-proclaimed Christian "Prophet" who correctly foretold an assassination attempt on Donald Trump three months before it occurred in Pennsylvania.

Biggs also predicted "red waves" in Michigan and Oklahoma for the 2024 election, predictions that ultimately came to pass in both states.

According to Biggs, he witnessed a vision of a "10-magnitude" earthquake hitting the New Madrid fault line, which spans Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Illinois, as reported by DailyMail.com on Friday. He explained that such a massive quake would set off a "chain reaction," leading to a 6.5-magnitude aftershock impacting areas from Texarkana, Texas, to Oklahoma. "It was so big, there were 1,800 people who died [along that stretch]," Biggs said in the video. "All the houses on cinder blocks were completely shaken to the foundation, they just fell."

He claimed that the Lord revealed to him that the New Madrid earthquake would occur three days after "they try to divide Jerusalem with the two-state solution for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East a policy that President Trump supported in 2nd term. Briggs' visions suggested that the earthquake would happen in the spring as he saw "Sycamore leaves on the trees… trying to come out… like they were fresh."

He told Cioccolanti that he saw Chinook helicopters flying in to bring aid, saying: "They were flying so low that they were shaking the houses." He added: "The Lord told me that when they try to divide Jerusalem with the two-state solution... you will see a three-day window. That's the time for people to flee.”
